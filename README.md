# Irish-energy
This reposetory contains codes for processing the Commission for Energy Regulation (CER) dataset gathered from users in Ireland. The goal of this project was to develop an anomaly detection system for this dataset using deep learning models. It is assumed that the original dataset does not contain anomalies, therefore, a method was developed to inject anomalies, using the patterns mentioned in <a href='https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7108042/'>this paper</a>, into the dataset. However, the patterns mentioned in the paper do not apply to most real instances of these anomalies.
